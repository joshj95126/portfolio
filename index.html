    <p> During the "Great Pandemic of 2020", I decided to make a change from working in Advertising Operations for the better part of the last decade.</p>
    <p> I decided to go with "Thinkful" to make said change, and it's been every bit worth it</p>
    <p> If you're looking for someone who brings the work ethic of someone who's worked in the trenches of Silicon Valley, with the creativity and "jack-of-all trades" ethos of a Full-Stack Developer, I'm your guy!</p>
